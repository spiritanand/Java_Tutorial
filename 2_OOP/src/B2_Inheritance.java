        // Take for instance computers. Computers are every where around us. All the computers have many things
        // in similar like they all have an on and an off switch, whereas they may operate on different
        // operating systems, but the basic functionality of a computer is similar.
        // So it would be waste of our computer class if we do not use the methods and fields already present
        // in it. After all computer programming is all for reusability of code. So in our new class (subclass) of
        // Apple laptops we could "inherit" all the methods and field variables present in the computer
        // "superclass".
        //
        // Superclass - The class from which inherit.
        // Subclass - The class in which we inherit.
        // Inheritance is an important pillar for OOP and Java. Inheritance allows us the reusability of code.
        // Now let us jump into our new superclass Computer.
