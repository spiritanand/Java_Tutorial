public class B3_Composition {
    /*
     Composition deals with a has-a relationship rather than is-a relationship in the case of inheritance.
     Take for example a Car. Porsche 911 is a car, whereas its doors, its engine and its headlights are not
     cars but part of the car 911 i.e, a Car has doors, engines and headlights rather than being a car they
     are a part of it.

     The need of composition is, when we need multiple classes to create a single class. Inheritance cannot
     solve this problem as by inheritance we can only inherit from a single class and we very quickly run
     into limitations.

     Lets now take the example of the class Car. Car has the components of a body and engine(for the sake of
     simplicity). Now the class of body and engine are not the super class of Car as a Car is neither.
     Lets look at the class of Engine (B3_C_Engine).
