        // Alright all this works fine. Pretty great right. Well imagine doing this for 30 or so field
        // variables.
        // That would be too cumbersome and lengthy. We do have a better way to enter (to initialize) our
        // parameters in a different way. That would be using constructors. Lets see this in our class
        // Account.

        // reason behind the order of the messages.
