public class B4_Polymorphism {
    /*
    Polymorphism is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.

    There are two types of polymorphism in Java:

    i)  compile-time polymorphism :-
            If you "overload" a static method in Java, it is the example of compile-time polymorphism.

    ii) run-time polymorphism :-
            Here, we will focus on runtime polymorphism in java. It occurs when we have many classes that  are
            "related to each other by inheritance".

    To get a better idea about polymorphism lets see an example. Jump to B4_C_Main for tuning into all the action.
