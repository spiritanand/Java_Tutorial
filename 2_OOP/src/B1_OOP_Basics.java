         In this section and the next few sections we are going to be looking at "Object Oriented Programming".
         We first need an in-depth understanding of what exactly are objects.
         We have real world objects all around us in the world. These have two important characteristics
         --> state and behaviour. For example for your dog the state might be 'state' of consciousness,
         breed, age , number of legs,etc, whereas the behaviour of the dog might be barking, eating,
         drinking, etc.

         The software objects are also very similar to the real world objects in that they too contain states
          and behaviours. An object stores it state in the form of fields i.e. variables and they expose their
          behaviour in the form of methods.

         So what are classes ? Well classes are a kind of blue print or template for creating objects. We
         have been dealing with classes all along. Take a look at the top of this program.

         So what are the uses of OOP in Java. Well to put it simply classes give us the power to create
         user defined data types. These data types can be much more powerful than our primitive data
         types. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions. We can basically treat our
         classes as data types and objects as variables that we will be creating using them.

         Lets get straight into it.
         
         In IntelliJ we can easily create classes by right clicking the src (source) folder. We are going
         to create the class of a Dog. In the project folder in the 2_OOP section look fot the "B1_C_Dog"
         .java file (this is our class file).
